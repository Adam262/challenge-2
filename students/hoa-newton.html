		My name is Hoa Newton. I came to the US in Dec 2010 from Vietnam. Vietnam is a tiny and beautiful country in South East Asia. I used to miss home very much. However, I am going to make the US my new home. I am falling in love with America even though it is very much colder than Vietnam. My favorite season is autumn when it is neither very hot nor cold. Winter here is quite depressing for me because I do not want to go out much when it is below freezing. 
		I love to cook. Sewing is also my favorite. I like Korean BBQ and I make it very often. I can also cook Vietnamese noodle soup which is a very popular dish. If you feel like interested in getting some Vietnamese dish recipes, I am very happy to share.
		I am working hard to achive success and  to set my professional career path in the US. I hope I can do well at this class to go further in web development.
